# Container vs VM

* Container - 
Containers are an **abstraction** at the app layer that packages _code and dependencies_ together.
Multiple containers can share the same kernel, but each running as **isolated processes** in user space.

* VM -
Virtual Machines are an **abstraction** of physical hardware _turning one server into many servers_.
The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an OS. VMs can be slow to boot.
