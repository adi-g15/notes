OSI Model Layers (Highest to Lowest):
  * Application
  * Presentation
  * Session
  * Transport
  * Network
  * Data Link
  * Physical

Each layer is a package of **protocols**, so Application layer doesn't include browser etc apps like Firefox, instead it includes Application Layer Protocols

## Application Layer

Used by user-space network applications, like Firefox, to access the _internet_, using protocls provided by this layer, such as
  * HTTP/S
  * FTP
  * NFS
  * FMTP
  * DHCP
  * SNMP
  * TELNET
  * POP3
  * IRC
  * NNTP
