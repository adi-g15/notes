# Permissioned blockchain

Generally implemented behind a firewall.

> And when needed for multiple comanies/networks to talk to each other, we create a virtual network such as through VPNs and other such technologies, enabling communication between different chains.

## Choice b/w permissioned and permissionless

When a network can "commoditize" trust, facilitating parties to transact without necessarily having to verify each other's identity, like Bitsoin, a permissionless is more suitable. Many of these involve sale/distribution to public.

Permissioned: In enterprises, use cases involve extensive vetting before parties agree to do business with each other.

## Permissioned P2P

Permissionless P2P systems don't require a set amount of peers to be online, and *are generally slower*.

Permissioned P2P networks have to guarantee uptime and require high quality of service on communication links.

> A blockchain network is a group of computers that informally are organized in a P2P architecture
> Consensus is a process where the peers synchronize the data on the blockchain
