# GNU info

Functionally `info` resembles man in many ways.
However, topics are connected using links (**even though its design predates the World Wide Web**)

## Usage

Typing `info` displays an index of available topics

* / for searching - And hit 'H' to get back to top
* n - next node
* p - previous node
* u - move one node up in index

## Page Structure

The topic which we view in an info page is called a 'node'.

Nodes are essentially sections, and subsections in the documentation.
Each node may contain menus and linked subtopics, or items.

Items function like browser links and are identified by an asterisk (\*) at the beginning of the item name.
