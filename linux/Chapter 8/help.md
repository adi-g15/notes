# The help command

When run within a bash command shell, some popular commands (such as echo and cd) actually run especially built-in bash versions of the commands rather than the usual binaries found on the file system, say under /bin or /usr/bin. It is more efficient to do so as execution is faster because fewer resources are used. (We will discuss command shells later.)
