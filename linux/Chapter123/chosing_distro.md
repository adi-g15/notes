Some questions worth thinking about before deciding on a distribution include:

  * What is the main function of the system (server or desktop)?
  * What types of packages are important to the organization? For example, web server, word processing, etc.
  * How much hard disk space is required and how much is available? For example, when   installing Linux on an embedded device, space is usually constrained.
  * How often are packages updated?
  * How long is the support cycle for each release? For example, LTS releases have long-term support.
  * Do you need kernel customization from the vendor or a third party?
  * What hardware are you running on? For example, it might be X86, ARM, PPC, etc.
  * Do you need long-term stability? Can you accept (or need) a more volatile cutting edge system running the latest software?

> Some distributions will also install more advanced security frameworks, such as SELinux or AppArmor. For example, all Red Hat-based systems including Fedora and CentOS always use SELinux by default, and Ubuntu comes with AppArmor up and running.

> Many installers can do an installation completely automatically, using a configuration file to specify installation options. This file is called a Kickstart file for Red Hat-based systems, an AutoYAST profile for SUSE-based systems, and a Preseed file for Debian-based systems.
