# IP address allocation

Typically a range of IP addresses are requested from your ISP by your organization's network admin.
If NAT is in operation, such as in home network, you only get one externally visible address.

Assigning the IP addresses -> Manual (Static IP addresses), or Dynamically (Assigned addresses can change every time you reboot or more often; the DHCP is used to assign IP addresses).
