# Compressing data

* gzip -> Most frequently used Linux compression utility
* bzip2 -> Produces files significantly smaller than those produces by gzip
* xz -> The most space-efficient compression utility used in Linux (can also be multi-threaded, takes too much time at level -9 compression, Linux source are distributed compressed by xz)
* zip -> Often required to work with archives from other operating systems

> tar is used to group multiple files in an archive, then compress them all at once

> Note @adig15 - There were usage too, but tereko pata hai mai waise bhi --help dekhke hi karunga wo :|
