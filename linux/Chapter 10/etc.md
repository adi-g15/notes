# The /etc directory

The /etc directory is the home for **system-wide configuration** files (only superuser can modify there).
It contains no binary programs, although some executable scripts are there.

Some entries -
* /etc/resolv.conf -> tells the system where to go on the network to obtain host name to IP address mappings (DNS)
* /etc/{passwd,shadow,group} -> for managing user accounts
