## Trim down kernel modules

> I can't say if this is before or after oldconfig, or it will override it completely

```sh
lsmod > my-old-lsmod
make LSMOD=my-old-lsmod localmodconfig
```

## Looking for regressions and new errors

Save logs from current kernel to compare and look for regressions and new errors, if any.
dmesg with `-t` option generates logs without timestamps

```sh
dmesg -t > dmesg_current
dmesg -t -k > dmesg_kernel
dmesg -t -l emerg > dmesg_current_emerg
dmesg -t -l alert > dmesg_current_alert
dmesg -t -l crit > dmesg_current_crit
dmesg -t -l err > dmesg_current_err
dmesg -t -l warn > dmesg_current_warn
dmesg -t -l info > dmesg_current_info
```

NOTE: If the dmesg_current is zero length, it is very likely that secure boot is enabled on your system. When secure boot is enabled, you wonâ€™t be able to boot the newly installed kernel, as it is unsigned. You can disable secure boot temporarily on startup with MOK manager. Your system should already have mokutil.

## Secure Boot

Required to install `mokutil` on Arch Linux

```sh
mokutil --sb-state
```

If you see the following, you are all set to boot your newly installed kernel:

SecureBoot disabled
Platform is in Setup Mode

If you see the following, disable secure boot temporarily on startup with MOK manager:

SecureBoot enabled
SecureBoot validation is disabled in shim

Disable validation:

```sh
doas mokutil --disable-validation
root password
mok password: 12345678
mok password: 12345678
doas reboot
```

To enable validation again, it is `doas mokutil --enable-validation`

## Early Printing

Enable printing early boot messages to vga using the `earlyprintk=vga` kernel boot option.
