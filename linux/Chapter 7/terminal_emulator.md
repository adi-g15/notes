A **terminal emulator** emulates (simulate) a standalone terminal within a window on the desktop.

It _behaves_ essentially as if you were logging into the machine at a pure text terminal with no running graphical interface.

> Most terminal emulators provide support for multiple terminal windows/tabs

### Examples

* gnome-terminal (GNOME default)
* xterm
* rxvt
* konsole
* terminator
