## Suspending

It works by keeping your systemâ€™s applications, desktop, and so on, in system RAM, but turning off all of the other hardware. This shortens the time for a full system start-up as well as conserves battery power.

> Note: modern Linux distributions actually boot so fast that the amount of time saved by suspending is often minor.
