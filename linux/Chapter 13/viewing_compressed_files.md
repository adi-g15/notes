# Viewing compressed files

These have specially designed versions:

* zcat file.gz
* zless file.gz
* zgrep file.gz
* zdiff file1.gz file2.gz

> zless can be used on uncompressed file too, it will still work and ignore decompression stage

> For compression method other than gzip, there exist others, for eg. bzcat,bzless and xzcat,xzless
